        <h1>instructions: how to help build the treasure map</h1>

<p>participating in junglegroves is about replacing cheap signals (likes/votes) with costly signals (donations) to reveal true priorities. here is how you can add your priorities to the map.</p>

<h2>1. choose your suggestion</h2>

<p>it can be anything, or nearly so. maybe you want me to plant more of my <i>ficus opposita x carica</i> hybrids to test for root knot nematode resistance, create a wildlife sanctuary, or even bulldoze the grove for a miniature golf course. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dBnQkitnJ92WRpRzvQrHRBIs3P-D0ev1FdzTkf_Go7o/edit?usp=sharing">censorship is anathema to me</a>, so virtually any critique, idea, or suggestion, including self-promotion, is welcome.</p>

<h2>2. make a donation</h2>

<p>the amount you donate conveys the strength of your preference. there are two ways to do this:</p>

<h3>option a (best method):</h3>
<p>to avoid exorbitant transaction fees, please message me directly for my personal paypal address so you can select "friends and family".</p>
<p>you can reach me via:</p>
<ul>
<li>facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/epiphyte">epiphyte</a></li>
<li>instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grows.on.trees">grows.on.trees</a></li>
<li>tropical fruit forum: <a href="https://tropicalfruitforum.com/index.php?action=profile;u=34646">epiphyte</a></li>
<li>inaturalist: <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/5347031">epiphyte78</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>option b:</h3>
<p>use the standard donate button on this site (fees will apply).</p>

<h2>3. leave a note</h2>

<p>whether you message me directly or use the donate button, please include the following details so i can properly attribute your contribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>what it's for (e.g., "kwai muk" or "wildlife sanctuary")</li>
<li>a link to any page (optional)</li>
<li>your username (from tff, inaturalist, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>i will manually update the rankings on the homepage as soon as i get a chance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>important: non-binding rankings</h2>

<p>please note that these rankings are <strong>non-binding</strong>. even though i receive and keep the money, i retain full control over the land. this means that even if "gas station" is ranked #1 with a total donation amount of $1 million, i might decide to continue experimenting with rare fruit trees. however, any entrepreneur who visits the junglegrove homepage wouldn't be able to overlook the considerable demand for a gas station. the purpose of your donation is not to buy a binding mandate, but to help construct a public "treasure map" of society's true priorities. by revealing the actual (relative) demand for things, you help ensure that nobody wastes society's limited resources by "opening a hardware store where nobody buys hardware" (an example from the economist israel kirzner). knowing is half the battle. thank you for helping me fight ignorance (of demand) with your hard-earned money.</p>
