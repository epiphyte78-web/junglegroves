  <h1>welcome to junglegroves</h1>

    <p>in 2025 i acquired 10 acres of orange grove in central florida, specifically in sebring.</p>

    <p>naturally i know what i want to do with the space, fill it with my fig hybrids like ficus opposita x carica, other rare fruit trees like kwai muk, endless epiphytes like encyclias, and hordes of happy hummingbirds.</p>

    <p>but the big question is: <b>what does the world want me to do with it?</b></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>private goods vs. public goods</h2>

    <p>the world's answer is typically determined by a rigged game of tug-of-war between <strong>private goods</strong> vs. <strong>public goods</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>if you want a gas station, you buy gas (a private good), which accurately signals demand.</li>
        <li>but if you want a wildlife sanctuary (a public good), you have to donate, which is plagued by the problem of <strong>free-riding</strong>, which severely weakens the demand signal.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>with buying vs. donating the playing field is never level; development unfairly has the upper hand.</p>

    <p><strong>junglegroves levels the playing field.</strong> the homepage is a fair arena where only donating is allowed. so it is donating vs. donating.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>it is donating for a bowling alley vs. donating for a botanic garden.</li>
        <li>it is donating for a gym vs. donating for a community center.</li>
        <li>it is donating for a golf course vs. donating for an animal shelter.</li>
        <li>it is donating for mcdonald's vs. donating for a soup kitchen.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>for the first time in human history, the playing field between things we typically buy (private goods) and things we typically donate for (public goods) will be completely level.</p>

    <p>it's important to note that the rankings are <strong>non-binding</strong>, meaning that i retain full control of the land, but the rankings create a public "treasure map" that everyone can freely use and benefit from.</p>

    <h2>help our garden grow... what?</h2>

    <p>to better understand <strong>donation ranking</strong>, consider this donation box at the south coast botanic garden in southern california:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhY6MHjcZKHVs0WPgx8iSpGnesLCQnrwLt3zcMwdeHnKtaaPkkk1ilzdNuGPpvJdWI7nAA6ygpn4swK8aUpSQZxsET3aEHjJ_7tYXKWRJXks67mbN7OfPfKOJuZy15dzrTdJjVKn34YY-VLbISosQTeMBXoIQvxEf99wo5kPepiy9XA-LqJQ3OVxDwKiIQ/s1128/20181119_132626%20(1).jpg" alt="south coast botanic garden original single donation box">
    </p>

    <p>the botanic garden asks for help to grow, but they don't ask <strong>what</strong> they should grow.</p>

    <p>imagine what would happen if there were 2 donation boxes, one for ornamentals and the other for edibles:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidPhufLZCp8gsHJzmWJq7PPFJ-bIBN_liS71XkAjR-jnsEQ5kT8aOFVz4vcvl2IIdUqygglKvKGUkGgGc_Su3L3_kgG4J6Bl-LJpHKP1Gnwfyv5LPDnPh58KR13Sul4iDuwlWjHeHLFBTZVEn2FFRbwJ3hRja6_soLMsA6ZjSvjSlPRTegPeoLDZ2WrY8/s1128/Screenshot%202025-12-04%2011.04.15%20AM.png" alt="two donation boxes: ornamentals vs edibles">
    </p>

    <p>it would be crystal clear that visitors want the garden to grow a lot more edibles than ornamentals. the people spoke with their wallets and revealed their true priorities. it is a completely fair contest of donating vs. donating. and for the very first time, visitors to the garden would see and know their collective priorities at a glance.</p>

    <p>now imagine if a 3rd donation box was added:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzEvje7H2Si6z0D9ZagLapTja3O13aRplPlt7AEIqtgRqmi_oo3Ye531N5Qk2vRxIhTobiHaJqUAmlPLOWkIy40PbGtzSFcPaptmDoquLuZx3m6cVrkC2HERzSLLff9WVrHX3JX_QPU7ki-Gu2smkuGSriucig7XzHIcZhCA-07ytmnzMe2_SncLnhEck/s1128/Screenshot%202025-12-04%2011.04.33%20AM.png" alt="three donation boxes: ornamentals, edibles, vs ornamental edibles">
    </p>

    <p>we'd see and learn that it actually turns out that the greatest demand by far is for <strong>ornamental edibles</strong> (pic is of chrysophyllum imperiale).</p>

    <p>therefore, the more options people are able to donate for, the more accurately the rankings reflect their true priorities.</p>

    <p>this is <strong>donation ranking</strong>: a virtuous cycle of everyone using their donations to highlight what should not be overlooked. because each participant is a teacher and a student, donation ranking is the most didactic feedback loop for defining "treasure". the ultimate mission of junglegroves is to reveal the truth of what society cares about the most.</p>

    <h2>standing on the shoulders of giants</h2>

    <p>the idea of using florida land to test and distribute useful plants has deep roots.</p>

    <p>in 1925, marvin "red" mounts became the first agricultural extension agent for palm beach county. like myself, he looked at the land and asked how it could best serve the people. but unlike with junglegroves, everyone in the world didn't have the opportunity to answer that question with their donations. instead, mounts had to rely on his own judgment to decide what to grow. he experimented with various veggies and rare fruit trees to discover which varieties could truly thrive in florida's climate - and those trials improved the health and finances of local farmers. what began as a practical experiment station eventually grew into mounts botanic garden.</p>

    <p>red mounts understood that introducing a useful plant to a community is one of the highest services a horticulturist can offer. but his era was <strong>top-down</strong>, a relic of the past that haunts the present and hinders progress.</p>

    <p><strong>junglegroves is the future</strong>: an experiment station whose direction isn't solely set by an owner/director/committee, or distracted/derailed by countless cheap signals (i.e. baby shark). instead, it's largely informed and influenced by the <strong>"multitude of counsellors"</strong> donating to elevate the most valuable and necessary ideas and improvements, making them impossible to overlook.</p>

    <p>whether it's testing my hybrid ficus opposita x ulmifolia for resistance to root-knot nematodes or providing habitat for the endangered florida grasshopper sparrow (ammodramus savannarum floridanus), or building a storage facility, the most precious path is illuminated by the community's costly (credible) signals.</p>

    <p>knowing is half the battle. by using donations to create an accurate treasure map of demand, we ensure that this 10-acre grove doesn't just grow, but that it grows the <strong>knowledge</strong> of what's truly most important to the community as a whole.</p>
