        <p>
            Welcome to Jungle Groves. This project catalogs and tracks data related to unique fruit tree genetics, including my hybrid fig crosses like the $317 "Charlie" fig ($Ficus opposita \times Ficus carica$), and research into specialty crops that thrive in environments like the orange grove we purchased in Sebring, Florida. The long-term goal is to better understand traits like root-knot nematode (RKN) resistance.

        <p>
            We're also exploring the core concept of the "seedling grafting paradox"—the idea that new, superior fruit genetics might be unknowingly discarded when seedlings are only used as rootstock for established cultivars like Hass avocado.
